# Uber-Trip-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
This project aims to design an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Uber trip data. The dashboard will provide insights into ride patterns, revenue trends, trip distances, and payment methods. It will include time-based analysis (hourly, daily, monthly), geographic visualization of pickup/drop-off locations, and key performances.

**Objective:** Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Uber trip patterns, revenue, and driver/payment insights to support data-driven decisions.
