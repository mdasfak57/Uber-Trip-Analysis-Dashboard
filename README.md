# Uber-Trip-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
This project aims to design an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Uber trip data. The dashboard will provide insights into ride patterns, revenue trends, trip distances, and payment methods. It will include time-based analysis (hourly, daily, monthly), geographic visualization of pickup/drop-off locations, and key performances.

**Objective:** Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Uber trip patterns, revenue, and driver/payment insights to support data-driven decisions.

## Project summary
This Power BI project contains a complete dashboard with three modules:
1. **Overview Analysis** — KPIs (total trips, revenue, avg fare), top pickups/dropoffs.  
2. **Time Analysis** — hourly, daily, monthly trends and peak times.  
3. **Details** — trip-level table, filters and drill-through for deep inspection.

## Files included
- `project.pbix` — Power BI Desktop file (open in Power BI Desktop).  
- `data/uber_trips.csv` — cleaned dataset used in the dashboard.  
- `assets/` — screenshots and demo GIF.  
- `docs/report.pdf` — exported report for quick review.  
- `code/measures.md` — DAX measures and important queries.  

## How to view
1. Download `Uber_Trip _Data_Analysis_ Dashboard.pbix` and open in **Power BI Desktop**.  
2. Or open `Uber trip analysis Report.pdf` for a static view.  


## Key features & highlights
- Time-based insights (hourly & daily peaks).  
- Geographical pickup/dropoff density map.  
- Interactive slicers (date range, pickup zone, payment type, driver).  
- Custom DAX measures for revenue and average fare.
